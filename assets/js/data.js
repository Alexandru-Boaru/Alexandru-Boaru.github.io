        Bloby's World is 2D platform game in which the player takes control of an alien blob. The goal of the game is to go through the levels and reach the finish line. During the levels, the players can also fight enemies and collect orbs in order to get a higher score. This project was created while learning the basics of game development with Unity, during my second bachelor year. It also opened new career posibilities to me, because it combines some of my main interests: programming, storytelling and visual arts.
        <br>
        Some of the gameplay features that I learnt how to implement are:
        <ul>
        <li>Basic platform motion commands: jump, double jump, crawl, glide</li>
        <li>Basic combat commands: shield, punch</li>
        <li>Two types of enemies with different behaviours and a multi-stage enemy boss</li>
        <li>Level progression and level completition persistence between sessions</li>
        <li>Different types of scene blocks with special behaviours: springs, spikes, jump-through platforms</li>
        </ul>

        A 3D puzzle adventure game made in Unity during the second semester of my third year as student. 
        This game is a group project for the Software Engineering course. I was the main gameplay programmer of the team, 
        as such my most important responsability was to manage the systems and components that the other team members developed. 
        <br>
        I was also tasked to work on gameplay features like: 
        <ul>
        <li><b>Player Controller</b>: the player can use the mouse to click on a scene surface or an object and the character uses the navmesh to find the shortest path toward destination.</li>
        <li><b>Cameras</b>: the scene is populated by a collection of carefully positioned cameras that point toward scene segments. The current camera is switched once the character passes from one scene segment to another.</li>
        <li><b>Scripted Events</b>: these events usually change the states of the items and the states of the mechanisms.</li>
        <li><b>Puzzle Progression System</b>: I developed a system that allows the possibility of solving multiple puzzles in parallel.</li>
        <li><b>User Interface</b>: inventory bar visuals and interaction.</li>
        <ul/>

        This is a game that started as a project for the 3DUPB summer school project and continued as my bachelor diploma project. It is a 2D Turn-Based RPG in which the player controls the Traveler, a character that wanders in the wastelands of a post-apocaliptic world, 
        helping small communities and hunting down the monsters that haunt the lands.<br>
        The purpose of this project is to repopularise the Turn-Based RPGs in 
        the video game industry. Following some interviews with possible clients and some market analysis, it 
        has been chosen to implement a 2D retro style Turn-Based RPG, which incorporates classical features of this 
        category, as well as some new functionality. 
        Some of the core features implemented for this project are:
        <ul>
        <li>Player character movement controller: the game has a top-down perspective, so the player can move the character in any direction 
        in a 2D plane</li>
        <li>Player character stats: the player character can level up by gaining experience points through collecting resources and battling 
        enemies. For each level-up, the player gains a stat point that can be used to increase one of the three character stats: HEALTH, 
        POWER and SPEED</li>
        <li>Battle system: the game uses a rpg turn based type of battle system. The player can control the actions of a single character. Some of the possible actions include: consuming an item, attacking one or more enemies at once and defending against enemy attacks</li>
        <li>Inventory and resource system: the player can collect resources from containers around the game world and from defeated enemies</li>
        <li>Weapons and abilities: the character uses three types of weapons, each one with different perks and abilities. These weapons 
        can be upgraded using the collected resources</li>
        <li>Quest system: the player receives different types of quests from the NPCs, such as Fetch Quests, in which the player needs to gather certain resources, Exploration Quests, in which the player needs to reach certain spots on in the game world, Battle Quests, in which the player needs to defeat certain enemies</li>
        <li>Enemies and AI: the game world is filled with plenty of enemies that have different abilities and dificulties. When the player gets close enough to wandering enemies, they start chasing the player. Once the player is caught, a turn based battle starts</li>
        <li>Game persistence and checkpoints: the player could save the current game progress at any available checkpoint in the world and resume the game from that place</li>
        </ul>
        Besides programming, I also created all the the visual art assets like the game world tiles, the characters and enemies sprites and animations, user interface and particle systems.

        One of the first courses from the Master's program introduced me to VR (virtual reality). While experimenting with this technology, I discovered how unfamiliar the controls were, especially the VR games controls. This gave me the idea to create a VR game with a hybrid control, which combines the classic video control scheme of video games with the motion tracking capabilities of virtual reality devices.
        <br><br>

        Thus, for my Master's Project I made a VR Metroidvania game that features this type of hybrid control scheme. Metroidvania is a genre of games in which the users discover, over time, skills and functionalities that facilitate the way they can explore and interact with the virtual world. It is also a type of game that has been getting more popular in recent years and that I personally enjoy.
        <br><br>

        On the one hand, the player can use the controllers to manipulate a character's actions, viewed from a third-person perspective, navigate a semi-open world full of obstacles, and fight various enemies to complete their mission.
        <br><br>
        
        On the other hand, the user can use the same controllers interact, in an immersive manner, with various elements and structures within the scenes in order to activate mechanisms and solve puzzles to allow the protagonist to advance.
        <br><br>
        
        This was probably my most ambitious project yet, considering the fact that I had to research new technologies, implement all the gameplay systems, test and balance different parameters and create assets in order to give shape to the game.
        <br><br>
        
        Some of the core challenges of this project were:
        <ul>
        <li>Researching and implementing the control scheme and VR interaction system</li>
        <li>Creating a customizable character movement controller with tailor-made physics like gravity swapping, swimming and sinking</li>
        <li>Implementing various skills that enable the player character to explore, fight and avoid obstacles</li>
        <li>Implementing skills that are manipulated by the motion tracking system and that are vital to completing the game. Such skills include breaking, cutting and picking up objects</li>
        <li>Creating triggers, mechanisms (ropes, breakable walls, lasers that can be reflected etc.) and puzzles which can be solved using the skills that are controlled by the motion tracking scheme</li>
        <li>Designing and implementing various enemeies and a challenging final boss type character</li>
        <li>Decorating the world with visual assets, like terrain, skybox, water and buildings</li>
        <li>Setting up models, animations, materials and visual effects for the characters</li>
        <li>Testing, fixing, polishing and finishing a playable demo on time</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
        <b>NOTE</b>: The project is not yet available in any official VR online store. An .apk app file is available in the project link below. The game be loaded into a Oculus Quest 2 device using Sidequest or adb (Android Debug Bridge)
